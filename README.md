# kittens-VR
A VR game inspiredd by Gorilla Tag.


So, you might be asking, why name this "gorilla tag clone" Kittens VR? Well, you probably have already guessed by now, but there will be kittens. Lots of them. Im going for a VR hangout/minigames game, where you hang out with your friends, jump around, and play tons of different minigames.

These first little prototypes for Kittens VR will just be tiny maps and tests that i threw together really quickly.

So, i hope you enjoy!

# How to download/play

1. download the .apk file (duh.)
2. use SideQuest to inject the .apk onto your Oculus Quest 1/2.
3. play!

Sadly, the game is only available for the Quest 1 and 2. More versions for more headsets will be here soon!
